 * Q3. Create a class called Date that includes three fields—a month (type int), a day (type int) and a
year (type int). Provide a constructor that initializes the three instance variables and assumes that
the values provided are correct. Provide a set and a get method for each instance
variable. Provide a method displayDate that displays the month, day and year separated by forward
slashes (/). Write a test application named DateTest that demonstrates class Date’s capabilities.
