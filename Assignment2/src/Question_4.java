/*
 * Q4. Create a class Point2D , in package - "com.app.geometry" : for representing a point in x-y co-
ordinate system. Create a parameterized constructor to init x & y co-ords. Add a method to return
string form of point's x & y co-ords

Hint : public String getDetails())
Add isEqual method to Point2D class :a boolean returning method : must return true if n only if
both points are having same x,y co-ords or false otherwise.
Add calculateDistance method to calculate distance between current point and specified point &
return the distance to the caller.

Hint : Use distance formula . Use java.lang.Math class methods --sqrt, pow etc.
Write TestPoint class , in package "tester" , with a main method, Accept co ordinates of 2 points
from user (Scanner) --to create 2 points (p1 & p2)

Use getDetails method to display point details.(p1's details & p2's details)

Invoke isEqual & display if points are same or different (i.e p1 & p2 are located at the same
position)
If they are not located at the same position , display distance between p1 & p2
