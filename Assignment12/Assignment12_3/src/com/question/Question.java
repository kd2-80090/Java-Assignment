  	3. Create a functional interface Arithmetic with single abstract method double calc(double,double). 
  	Write a static method calculate() in main class as follows.   		
  	In main(), write a menu driven program that inputs two numbers from the user 
	and calls calculate() method with appropriate lambda
	expression (in arg3) to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations.
	
	static void calculate(double num1, double num2, Arithmetic op) {
	double result = op.calc(num1, num2);
	System.out.println("Result: "+result);
	}
